    "In this lab, we explore different prompting strategies to enhance interactions with foundation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will experiment the following approaches: \n",
    "1. Basic Prompting – Learn how to craft clear and effective prompts.\n",
    "2. Role-Based Prompting – Use system prompts to align responses with specific roles.\n",
    "3. In-Context Learning (Few-Shot Prompting) – Enhance model performance by providing relevant examples.\n",
    "4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting – Implement step-by-step reasoning strategies.\n",
    "5. ReAct Prompting with Web Search – Combine reasoning and action-driven prompting to retrieve real-time information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Different GenAI models have unique approaches to writing prompts. To get the best results, refer to their official documentation for prompt templates designed for specific use cases:\n",
