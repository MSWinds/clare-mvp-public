    "In RAG, Query translation (also known as query transformation or query expansion) is a step where the user’s input query is reformatted, translated, or expanded to improve document retrieval from a vector database or search index. This step aims to  enhance retrieval accuracy, especially in similarity-based searches, where slight variations in wording might lead to missed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG summary image from this module's reading includes several query translation techniques: \n",
    "1. Multi-Query Generation: Generate multiple variations of a query. \n",
    "    - Given a single user query, an LLM rephrases it into multiple alternative queries. \n",
    "    - The system then retrieves documents for each variation and merges the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. RAG-Fusion: Retrieve documents using multiple retrieval strategies and fuse the best results.\n",
    "    - Runs multiple retrieval strategies in parallel.\n",
    "    - Merges results using re-ranking to select the most relevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Decomposition: Break down complex queries into simpler sub-queries.\n",
    "    - A long or multi-part query is decomposed into smaller, independent queries.\n",
    "    - The system retrieves documents for each sub-query and aggregates results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Step-Back Prompting: Reformulate a high-level abstract question into a more concrete query for better retrieval.\n",
    "    - If the user asks a vague or abstract question, the system \"steps back\" and rephrases it into a more answerable form.\n",
    "    - Uses an LLM to generate a specific version of the abstract question.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE): Instead of retrieving based on the query, the system generates a hypothetical answer and searches for similar documents.\n",
    "    - The LLM generates a \"hypothetical\" document as if it already had an answer.\n",
    "    - The hypothetical document is embedded into a vector representation.\n",
    "    - The system retrieves documents that are most similar to this generated text.\n",
