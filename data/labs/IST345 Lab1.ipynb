Additional parameters are also explained here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LiewZPDDUpor"},"source":["#### 1. Temperature\n","\n","In OpenAI models, the **temperature** parameter controls the randomness and creativity of text generation. Its value typically ranges from `0` to `1`, where **lower values** make responses more predictable, and **higher values** introduce more variation. It can exceed `1` at times.\n","\n","**Low Temperature (close to 0)**\n","\n","- Produces more **deterministic** and **consistent** responses.\n","- Prioritizes the words with the highest probability.  \n","- Best for tasks that require **accuracy and consistency**, such as:\n","  - Answering factual questions\n","  - Generating technical documents\n","\n","**High Temperature (close to 1 or higher)**\n","- Introduces more **random** and **diverse** in responses.\n","- Allows the model to select words with lower probabilities, making responses more unique.\n","- Best for tasks requiring **creativity and diversity**, such as:\n","  - Creative writing (stories, poety)\n","  - Open-end discussion\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 2. Max_tokens\n","\n","The **max_tokens** parameter controls the maximum length of the generated response. A token can be a word, a subword, or a punctuation mark. It is used for:\n","\n","- **Controlling Response Length**  \n","   - Prevent responses being too long nor too short.\n","\n","- **Managing API Costs & Efficiency**  \n","   - Longer responses consume more tokens, increasing API usage and cost.\n","   - Setting a reasonable **max_tokens** value helps optimize performances.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### 3. Other parameters\n","\n","- **Top_p (Nucleus Sampling - only in OpenAI)**:  Controls probability mass for selecting tokens. Instead of choosing words strictly by probability, it dynamically selects only the most probable words until a cumulative probability threshold (e.g., 0.9) is reached.\n","- **Top_k (Common in Claude/Hugging Face models)**: Limits the selection to only the k highest-probability words, filtering out lower-ranked choices.\n","- **Frequency_penalty**: Reduces repetition by penalizing overused words in the response. Higher values discourage word repetition.\n","- **Presence_penalty**: Encourages the introduction of new words and topics by slightly boosting the probability of uncommon words.\n","- **Stop Sequences**: Defines specific tokens or phrases that signal the model to stop generating. Example: [\"\\n\", \"User:\"] makes the response stop when a newline or \"User:\" appears.  \n","\n","By tweaking these parameters, you can fine-tune OpenAI models for different tasks and improve response quality based on your need.\n","\n","Click [Understand Your Understanding OpenAI Parameters](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/understanding-openai-parameters-how-to-optimize-your-prompts-for-better-outputs?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for more information.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VZhB6YwEUpot"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define the input prompt (query) for the GPT model\n","query = \"Continue your story with the following: In a distant village, there lived a mysterious old man....\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gZoCs8Eejr3C","outputId":"d33fe16f-2eca-4e70-c27f-f84ac240b0b9"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/markdown":["In a distant village, there lived a mysterious old man known to the locals as Elias. His small, weathered cottage sat at the edge of the dense forest that bordered the village, a place where few dared to venture. The villagers often spoke in hushed tones about Elias, weaving tales of magic and wonder around his enigmatic presence. Some said he was a wizard, others a guardian of ancient secrets, but no one truly knew the extent of his powers or the truth of his past.\n","\n","Elias was a solitary figure, rarely seen in the village except for the occasional visit to the market, where he would trade herbs and peculiar trinkets for supplies. His eyes, a piercing shade of blue, seemed to hold the wisdom of ages, and his long, silver beard gave him an air of timelessness.

Shelves lined with ancient books and jars filled with colorful powders and dried herbs surrounded a large, wooden table cluttered with strange instruments.
